The .misc suffix not configured in pyproject.toml so it is not shown.

We could define this in pyproject.toml:

[[tool.towncrier.type]]
directory = "misc"
name = "Miscellaneous:"
# This type is not shown.
showcontent = false

But then towncrier still creates a Miscellaneous sub header without the content of this file, but *with* the issue number...
