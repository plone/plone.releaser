Remove empty section from mxcheckouts.ini.
This is when calling `bin/manage remove-checkout`: when disabling a checkout, we can remove the entire section.
You must have `default-use = false` in the settings of this file.
The code is simplified to not support the default value of `default-use = true`: the Plone coredev buildout does not want this.
